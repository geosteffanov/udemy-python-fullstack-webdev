	<h3> Let's start with an example:</h3>

	<form action="https://www.google.com/?" method="get"> <!-- now whenever someone clicks the 'Submit' button the browser
															 redirects to the url specified in the 'action' attribute and
															 we can use the parameters of our input to pass to the new 
															 website -->
		<input type="text" name="q">     <!-- now whenever someone clicks 'Submit' the parameters of the url change to
												  include userinput='...', where '...' is whatever the value of the input was -->
		<input type="submit" value="Submit"> 
	</form>



	<h3> Here's another example, for labels:</h3>

	<form>
		<label for="userinput" "Opinion: ">Opinion: </label>
		<input id="userinput" type="text" required placeholder="Enter some text..."> <!-- we are using this id to link to a label, and we are
																			 	 we are using a placeholder because its funky -->
																			 	 <!-- thre required attribute makes sure that the field isnt empty when the form is submitted -->
        <input type="submit">

	</form>
